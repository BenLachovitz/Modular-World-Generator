# 🌍 **Modular World Generator**

The **Modular World Generator** is a Unity Editor tool designed to **rapidly create full, game-ready scenes** — including terrain, buildings, roads, NPCs, vehicles, foliage, and navigation systems.
Unlike typical world-building tools that generate only terrain or vegetation, this tool provides **complete scene generation** with **intuitive controls**, **editor integration**, and **scalable licensing**.

This repository contains the full source code, editor scripts, algorithms, and documentation from the final B.Sc. Computer Science project by **Ben Lachovitz** and **Guy Zvilich**.

# 🔍 **Overview**

Modern game development demands fast iteration and efficient content creation.
This tool solves that need by offering:

* Full-scene procedural generation
* A clean & simple Unity Editor interface
* Configurable world parameters
* Randomization *within* logical constraints
* Grid-based placement for clean and realistic scenes
* Integrated navigation for NPCs and vehicles
* Cloud-based PRO licensing using **Supabase**

This makes it ideal for:

* Prototyping levels
* Generating multiple scene variations
* Indie developers without large art teams
* Students and researchers studying procedural generation

# ⚙️ **How It Works**

The generator follows a **structured grid-based pipeline**:

1. **Terrain Setup**
2. **Road Generation (horizontal/vertical)**
3. **Grid Cell Partitioning**
4. **Asset Placement (with spacing & logic)**
5. **NavMesh Build**
6. **Population Spawning**
7. **Validation Pass**

This ensures scenes are both:

* Visually coherent
* Logically structured
* Stable for gameplay

# 🧩 **System Architecture**

### **🟦 Editor Layer**

* Handles user input
* Displays tool UI
* Sends parameters to generation engine

### **🟩 Logic Layer**

* GridGenerator
* PlacementEngine
* NavigationHandler
* AssetManager

### **🟪 Backend Layer**

* Supabase key validation
* HTTP requests via UnityWebRequest

# 🧠 **Generation Algorithm**

### **1. Road-Based Grid Creation**

* Roads divide the terrain into structured cells
* Prevents chaotic or overlapping layouts

### **2. Placement Logic**

* Buildings → building cells
* NPCs → walkable areas
* Vehicles → roads
* Trees → parks

Rules ensure spacing and alignment:

```txt
- No overlaps  
- Respect boundaries  
- Align to grid axes  
- Randomized position offset  
```

### **3. Navigation System**

* NavMesh baked after placement
* NPCs use roaming / idle / patrol
* Vehicles follow custom paths

---

# 📥 **Installation**

### **Requirements**

* Unity **2023.2.20f1** or later
* .NET Framework compatible with Unity
* Internet connection (for PRO license features)

### **Steps**

1. Clone the repository
2. Open Unity → select project folder
3. Navigate to:
   **Tools → Modular World Generator**
4. Start generating scenes instantly

---

# 🕹 **Usage Guide**

### **1. Open the Tool**

Inside Unity:

```
Window → Tools → Modular World Generator
```

### **2. Set Your Parameters**

* Terrain size
* Road density
* Building count
* NPC count
* Vehicle count
* Materials
* Presets

### **3. Click Generate**

The tool will:

* Build the terrain
* Draw roads
* Place assets
* Bake NavMesh
* Spawn NPCs & vehicles

### **4. Need a new variation?**

Click **Regenerate Scene**
→ All new placements
→ New randomness
→ Same constraints

---

# 🔐 **Pro License System**

The tool includes a cloud-based licensing system using **Supabase**.

### **Pro Features Include**

* Full-scene automatic generation
* Preset saving & loading
* Batch generation
* Extended asset categories

### **How It Works**

1. User enters license key
2. Unity sends an HTTPS request to Supabase
3. Key validated against secure RLS database
4. Rechecked every 10 minutes

### **Admin Tool (Python)**

* Issue keys
* Revoke keys
* Monitor usage & activation

# ⚡ **Performance Benchmarks**

| Operation               | Target   | Achieved  |
| ----------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Manual Scene Generation | ≤ 2 sec  | ~1 sec    |
| Full Random Scene       | ≤ 40 sec | 20–30 sec |
| License Validation      | ≤ 3 sec  | 1–2 sec   |
| Save/Load Settings      | ≤ 2 sec  | ~1 sec    |

# ⚠️ **Limitations**

* Asset quality depends on user's prefab library
* Designed only for **Unity**, not Unreal/Godot
* Complex scenes may hit memory limits on low-end PCs
* Dynamic runtime regeneration not yet supported
